    "## 6. (20 points): Two-body problem and python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists of developing your own standalone python module to simulate a two-body problem. The module accepts initial parameters from the user and delivers customised simulations of two-body systems where the interaction between the two bodies is of gravitational nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we will assume that the most massive object of mass $M$ is our Sun and it is located at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$, while the other object is the Earth of mass $m$ and orbits around the Sun. In this coordinate system the position of the Earth is $\\vec{r}=x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y}$, which is the vector pointing from the Sun to the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "We can write the ODE system describing the motion of Earth as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}=\\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}=-\\frac{G\\,m\\,M}{r^3}\\vec{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $m$ cancels out. In addition, Kepler’s third law for $M\\gg m$ states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$4\\,\\pi^2\\,a^3\\approx{G\\,M}\\,T^2$, \n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the elliptical relative motion of one object relative to the other and the $T$ is the orbital period. If $a$ is in astronomical units (where $1 AU\\equiv$ distance between the Sun and the Earth), $T$ is in $yr$, and $M$ is in solar masses, then $a^3 = T^2$, so $4\\,\\pi^2 \\approx G\\,M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At $t=0$, we will place the Earth at perihelion (i.e., at the point in the orbit at which the Earth is closest to the Sun). Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_0 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_0 = a\\,(1-e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{x0} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{G\\,M}{a}\\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{y0} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. The present value for the eccentricity of the Earth is: $e=0.01671$\n",

    "### Code development (12 points):\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a single python script **kepler.py**, adequately organised in classes and functions, that:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) initialises the two-body problem on a 2D Cartesian grid with an option to save the initial map (if the user wishes to do so). Use the Argparse Library to facilitate user customisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) includes three methods to carry out Runge-Kutta integrations (RK2, RK3 and RK4).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) includes a function for the slopes given by the above equations of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) includes a run class to integrate the above system of ODEs for $T=5$ orbital periods and saves the history of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun into an output file. **Note:** Both ODEs need to be integrated simultaneously, so you don't need separate functions for the integration of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) includes an animation class that reads the Earth's orbital history and returns a GIF animation containing the Earth position and velocity at different times. The user should be able to turn on a flag at runtime to indicate if the GIF animation is desired. Use the Argparse Library to add this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) accepts as inputs from the user: $e$, $T$, and the numerical method (\"RK2\", \"RK3\" or \"RK4\") to update the ODE system. Use the Argparse Library to add this functionality. **Note:** Please provide an example of how I should execute your code in the README.md file and include your simulations in the **outputfolder** for a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis (8 points):\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single python notebook **analysis.ipynb**, add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Use your script to generate three simulations: one for $e=0.01671$ (Earth's eccentricity), one for $e=0.25$ (which is Pluto's eccentricity), and one for $e=0.967$ (Halley's comet eccentricity) for $T=5$ and RK2.\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) What would happen if Earth would have the eccentrity of Pluto or Halley's comet? It may be helpful to compare the orbital history for all values of $e$ in a single plot throughout time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Use your script to generate two additional simulations only for $e=0.01671$ (Earth's eccentricity) with  RK3 and RK4.\n",
    "\n",
    "(j) Use your script to measure convergence of the simulations with RK3 and RK4 for $e=0.01671$ by integrating at a number of different time steps. To analyse convergence, you need to define some measure for the error, e.g., you can consider the change in radius after one period (i.e., at $T=1$), and then plot it against different time steps for both RK methods. Thus, you should add additional functions for this to your code in **kepler.py**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please include all your simulation outputs in the **outputfolder** for a reference."
