    "We want to study the spectral properties of turbulent flows using Fourier analysis. Let us consider an isothermal turbulence-in-a-box simulation:\n",

    "This simulation introduces a stochastic force field to generate turbulent motions in an isothermal ($\\gamma=1$) gas initially at rest. Turbulence is continuously generated throughout the whole simulation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation folder contains 101 VTK files, jointly with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **units.out** file that contains the CGS normalisation values.\n",
    "- a **vtk.out** file whose second column contains the times in code units.\n",
    "- a **grid.out** file that contains information on the grid structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each VTK file stores the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- density (rho)\n",
    "- velocity_x (vx1)\n",

    "**Design and organise your python code into a module using object-oriented programming, i.e. python classes. Your module should have python classes with fixed parameters as attributes and functions as methods, which together should perform the following tasks (when called):**\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Read and return the above data fields normalised in CGS units for any input VTK file.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Make 2D maps of any scalar or vector field with show and print options. **Note:** Remember that for high-resolution vector field maps, visualisation can be improved by adjusting the grid resolution via interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Carry out 2D Fourier transforms of any scalar field and return its 2D Fourier spectrum with its corresponding frequencies (in the correct units).\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Apply a high-pass filter and a Gaussian blurring filter to any 2D scalar fields and return the processed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Collect a set of 2D images and return a GIF animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then, create a python notebook called turbulence.ipynb where you import and use the functionality of your own module to show the following outputs for the VTK file # 40:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Display maps of the velocity vector field and the magnetic vector field.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Display the original density field and its 2D Fourier image.\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Display a high-pass filter map of the density field, and two ot its images blurred with two different Gaussian variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, loop over all the VTK files and:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Save the high-pass filter density maps at all times into an output directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "(j) Display a movie showing the time evolution of the high-pass filter density maps (saved in the output directory). What are you capturing in these maps?\n",
