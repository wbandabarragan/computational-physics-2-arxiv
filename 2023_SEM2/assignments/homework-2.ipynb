    "## Problem 1 (10 points): Thermodynamics and Heat Conduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Please include your solutions to this problem within a single python notebook file: **metalconduction.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use appropriate numerical algorithms to study how the temperature profile in a heated metal wire evolves in time, under different initial and boundary conditions. For this, you need to solve the 1D heat equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}=\\alpha\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T=T(x, t)$ describes the temperature of the metal, $x$ is position, $t$ is time, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the metal. We will consider two metals as I explain below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the metal wire has a length of $20\\,\\rm cm$, and choose the wire midpoint as the origin for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial temperature profile in degrees Celsius is given by the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(x, 0)= 175 - 50\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{5}\\right) - x^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is in units of $\\rm cm$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Imagine we keep the temperatures at the edges of the metal wire fixed at a temperature of $25\\,\\rm C$. Construct a Crank-Nicolson algorithm to simulate the evolution of the temperature profile and find the time in seconds at which thermal equilibrium is reached in two metal wires (one made of Copper with $\\alpha=111\\,\\rm \\frac{mm^2}{s}$ and one made of Iron with $\\alpha=23\\,\\rm \\frac{mm^2}{s}$ ).  **Hint:** you need to define some criterion to determine thermal equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Can we use explicit or FFT methods to solve the problem described in literal (a)? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Make a labeled animation showing six panels (with 2 columns and three rows): the top two panels should show the time evolution of the 1D temperature profile of each metal wire, the medium two panels how the temperature surface is built up in time, and the bottom two panels the surface projection onto the $x$-$t$ plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Re-study heat diffusion only in the Copper wire, but this time add some noise $f(x)$ with amplitude $\\beta$ to the initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(x, 0)= 175 - 50\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{5}\\right) - x^2 + \\beta\\,f(x)\\,g(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need to find an appropriate apodization function $g(x)$ so that the initial boundary conditions remain fixed at $25\\,\\rm C$. Similarly, you should choose an amplitude for the noise function to be less than a hundredth of the peak temperature value. Does adding the noise change the time at which thermal equilibrium is reached or not? Why yes or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Re-study heat diffusion only in the Copper wire for the original $T(x, 0)$, but this time assume that the boundaries cannot be kept constant (because of e.g. a faulty cooling system). Instead they also evolve in time according to the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(-10\\,{\\rm cm}, t) = 25 + 0.1\\,t$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(+10\\,{\\rm cm}, t) = 25 + 0.3\\,t$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T(x, t)$ is in degrees Celsius, and $t$ in seconds. Run the simulation until the temperature profile shows a quasi-linear trend. **Hint:** you need to define some criterion to determine quasi-linearity.\n"

    "## Problem 2 (10 points): Heat equation and MPI point-to-point parallelisation\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem aims at parallelising a python routine using MPI point-to-point parallelisation. The python routine uses the FFT method we studied in class to solve the heat equation for an initial cosine temperature profile. You can find the base code (**diffusion.py**) here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-2/blob/main/assignments/diffusion.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study diffusion for a long time scale, and thus we wish to reduce at least some of the computing time using the MPI library. Download the serial code and carry out the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Copy the default script above and create a **diffusionMPI.py** script. Edit the new script, importing the **MPI** and **mpi4py** libraries and adding time stamps around the main operations performed by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Add the MPI communicator to get the size and core information of your computer. Also, set up the workload parameters for each rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Now we want to parallelise the iFFT part of the code. Since the solution is already stored in a 2D array, we can split the time axis and distribute it along the processors. Look for the following lines in the code and use point-to-point communication to parallelise your routine. When it is done, test your parallelisation by running the code with 1 and 2 processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# We want to parallelise the code from here onwards\n",
    "for k in range(len(t)):\n",
    "    inv_u_solution[k, :] = np.fft.ifft(u_solution[k, :])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) As you have noticed, the plotting section of the code is not parallelised yet, so the PNG image contains half the solution. Thus, our job is to parallelise the section below too. There are several ways to achieve this, but we will use point-to-point communication, so your task is to make all ranks $\\neq 0$ **send** their sub-arrays to rank $=0$. Then, rank $=0$ **receives** them, reconstructs the full array, and makes the plot. Make sure your code is memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# Plotting the solution:\n",
    "# Add colour\n",
    "R = np.linspace(1, 0, len(t))\n",
    "B = np.linspace(0, 1, len(t))\n",
    "G = 0\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize= (10, 6))\n",
    "for j in range(len(t)):\n",
    "\tplt.plot(x, inv_u_solution[j, :].real, color = [R[j], G, B[j]])\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"position [m]\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"temperature [$\\degree$ C]\")\n",
    "plt.savefig(\"parallel_output.png\")\n",
    "plt.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Copy your **diffusionMPI.py** script to the CEDIA cluster (or the Imbabura cluster) via SSH, reserve computing resources (e.g. $8+$ cores), then run your code using mpirun/mpiexec. Export log files from each run, so that the run times can be analysed later. Include the log files and all your SLURM job scripts in the **outputfolder.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Write a python notebook **scalingMPI.ipynb** that opens the log files produced by the serial run and all the different parallel runs. Make a plot with computing time on the Y-axis and number of cores on the X-axis. Display Amdahl's law, compare it to your results, and comment on the findings. **Note:** Please add all your plots to the **outputfolder**.\n"
