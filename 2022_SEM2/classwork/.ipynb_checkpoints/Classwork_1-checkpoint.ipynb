    "\n",
    "A popular method for integrating ODEs with a high order of accuracy is the **Butcher's Runge-Kutta method**. It is obtained by following a similar approach to the one we discussed in class. This method uses six points $k_1, k_2, k_3$, $k_4$, $k_5$, and $k_6$. A weighted average of these points is used to produce the approximation of the solution. The algorithm relies on computing the following slopes:\n",
